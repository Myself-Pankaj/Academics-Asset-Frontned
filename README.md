## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the React Frontend App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

## 💡 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the development server for the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes. You can enjoy the smooth animations powered by **Framer Motion** and the modular, maintainable styles using **Sass**.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizes the build for performance, and applies the styling powered by **Sass**.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed with the delightful animations from **Framer Motion**.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you're on your own, but with the added power of **React-Redux** state management.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small to large deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be as powerful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.
